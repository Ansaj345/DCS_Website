						<p>‘The Earth has enough resources for our needs, but not for our greed’, famously said Mahatma Gandhi in one of his speeches.
                            True, the environment is our natural surroundings which include plant, animal, and non-living objects across the land, 
                            water bodies, and skies that support life on this planet. They all are for our needs but not for our greed.Hence every year 
                            5 June is celebrated as World Environment Day, touted as one of the biggest environmental events across the globe. The event 
                            is led by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), which inspires efforts and positive changes to the environment and 
                            highlights the dangers to our natural world, and urges people to protect it.</p>
